# üõçÔ∏è ProdReco - Product Recommendation System

**ProdReco** is an intelligent product recommendation system built using product data from Flipkart. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and vector-based similarity techniques to suggest the top 5 most relevant products similar to a given search query. The entire project is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit** app.

## üöÄ Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed product descriptions using NLP techniques
- Built a corpus using various vectorization methods: `TF-IDF`, `BoW`, `Word2Vec`, `GloVe`, `FastText`
- Identified **Word2Vec** as the best-performing embedding technique for this dataset
- Generated a **cosine similarity matrix** to compare product descriptions
- Returns **top 5 product recommendations** with similarity scores
- Fully functional and easy-to-use **Streamlit UI**

## üß† Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**
    - Removal of stopwords, punctuation, special characters, and symbols
    - Applied stemming and lemmatization for normalization
    - Cleaned product titles and descriptions

2. **Corpus Creation**
    - Constructed a text corpus from cleaned product descriptions
    - Tokenized and embedded the corpus using various vectorization techniques

3. **Similarity Computation**
    - Applied `cosine similarity` on the embedded corpus
    - Built a similarity matrix to identify the top 5 similar products

4. **Recommendation Engine**
    - User inputs a product name or keyword
    - App returns 5 closest matching products along with similarity scores
