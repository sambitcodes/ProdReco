# 🛍️ ProdReco - Product Recommendation System

**ProdReco** is an intelligent product recommendation system built using product data from Flipkart. It leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) and vector-based similarity techniques to suggest the top 5 most relevant products similar to a given search query. The entire project is deployed as an interactive **Streamlit** app.

## 🚀 Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed product descriptions using NLP techniques
- Built a corpus using various vectorization methods: `TF-IDF`, `BoW`, `Word2Vec`, `GloVe`, `FastText`
- Identified **Word2Vec** as the best-performing embedding technique for this dataset
- Generated a **cosine similarity matrix** to compare product descriptions
- Returns **top 5 product recommendations** with similarity scores
- Fully functional and easy-to-use **Streamlit UI**

## 🧠 Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**p 5 similar products

4. **Recommendation Engine**
    - User inputs a product name or keyword
    - App returns 5 closest matching products along with similarity scores

    - Removal of stopwords, punctuation, special characters, and symbols
    - Applied stemming and lemmatization for normalization
    - Cleaned product titles and descriptions

2. **Corpus Creation**
    - Constructed a text corpus from cleaned product descriptions
    - Tokenized and embedded the corpus using various vectorization techniques

3. **Similarity Computation**
    - Applied `cosine similarity` on the embedded corpus
    - Built a similarity matrix to identify the to

## 🧪 How to Run Locally

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ProdReco.git
   cd ProdReco

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash 
    pip install -r requirements.txt

3. **Run the Streamlit app**:
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py

## 🎯 Future Improvements
1. Integrate deep learning-based embedding models like BERT or SBERT

2. Add user login and history-based recommendations

3. Expand dataset for multi-category recommendation

4. Deploy as a web service via Docker or cloud platforms
